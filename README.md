# Project Specification

The customer would like an on-line system to enter details for the latest Doodle branch. Doodle is a
engineering and tech company. Their most popular product is a browser. The system must take details
of their requirements to ensure that all needs of the branch are listed for a building contractor. For
example, they may wish to have a 538,000 square feet building for the data center. It may need to be
held underwater. The requirements gathering system should be clean and simple. The system needs
to take into account the usual details about dimensions and cost/budget. It must be possible to upload
files or images which may be sample construction diagrams. Jpgs are fine. Do not worry about autocad,
etc. The administrator should be able to access detailed information and edit as appropriate. Once
the client enters details it should not be able to be changed by the client.
