# Security Testing (Greenlight) POC

This Proof of Concept is to determine the feasibility for using Greenlight for Security scanning within this Project


## Veracode Greenlight
Veracode Greenlight scans files or small packages and delivers results back quickly, enabling developers to test software quickly and frequently, and find security-related defects when they are the easiest and cheapest to fix, during development.

The following list outlines the IDEs and languages that Veracode Greenlight supports.


- Android Studio
- Eclipse 
    - Greenlight for Eclipse supports Java and the Java platforms and frameworks listed in the Compilation Instructions for Java.
    - Greenlight for Eclipse can scan:
        - Java files and packages that compile correctly in Java projects.
        - JavaScript embedded in the following file types: ASP, CSS, EHTML, ES, ES6, HANDLEBARS, HBS, HJS, HTM, HTML, JS, JSX, JSON, JSP, MAP, MUSTACHE, PHP, TS, TSX, XHTML.
        - Java Server Page (JSP) files and folders that contain JSP files.
        - Non-minified1 JavaScript files and folders containing JavaScript files in JavaScript projects.
- IntelliJ
- Spring Tool Suite
- Visual Studio 
    - Greenlight for Visual Studio supports .NET and the .NET platforms and frameworks listed in Compilation Instructions for .NET. Greenlight for Visual Studio can only scan:
        - CS, CS, VB, JS, ASCX, ASHX, or ASPX files that are a part of a .NET project that compiles correctly.
        - JavaScript embedded in the following file types: HTM, HTML, JS, TS.

## Conclusion

Primlinary analysis suggests that it mightnt be suitable for python.
