##      Starting mongo from command line

1.	Download MongoDB

2.	When Installing MongoDB, choose Complete version not custom. You can choose custom if you want a smaller/easier naming convention.

3.	Go into command prompt and cd into MongoDB

"(C:) > Program Files > MongoDB > Server > 4.0 > bin"

4.	Then type "mongod" into the command prompt. An error should appear.

5.	When this happens, just create a folder on your local disk (C drive) called data and another folder in data called db.The path should look like:

"(C:)> data > db"

6.	After you created folders, run the mongod command again and it should be successful.

7.	Open another cmd and type in "mongo".

"C:\Users\Conor Dorrian> mongo"

8.	This will open the mongo shell. From here you can create a database etc.
