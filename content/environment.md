## Local Development Environment

The local development environment uses Vagrant, Ansible and Virtualbox. When deployed it sets up the full Doodle application stack on your workstation for testing.

### Setup

please see documentation here:
- [Vagrant](../src/infra/vagrant/README.md)

### FAQ / KB

## Hosted Environment

The staging and production environments are hosted in LYIT-DC esxi virtual hosts. Architecture VMs are deployed manually with Terraform "Infrastructure as Code".

Configuration management is carried out by Ansible. A pipeline is setup in Jenkins to test and continuously provision to staging VMs using the Ansible code. Production VMs are provisioned manually.  

### Setup

see documentation here:

- [Terraform](../src/infra/terraform/README.md)
- [Ansible](../src/infra/ansible/README.md)

### FAQ / KB

#### Golden image

The terraform code relies on a golden disk image to be present in /backup folder of esxi datastore. This was created manually. It is copied by terraform to create each new VM.

#### Endpoints

There is no DNS entrys in LYIT-DC for our services. you will need to use IPs to resolve the service. all services run on port 8080

#### dns:

For service discovery between VMs, the following static entries are setup on all VMs:

```
api.internal.tld
web.internal.tld
```
#### esxi terraform problems

The esxi host doesn't play nicely with terraform. There is a problem with the copy disk image step. After running terraform, it is necessary to manually copy the golden image in the datastore explorer before starting VMs.
