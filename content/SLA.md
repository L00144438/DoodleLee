    We will respond to all general requests for support within 24 business hours from the time of your request. We will do our best to get back to you much sooner, but we are a small company, so we appreciate your patience.

## Impact
Impact will be the measure of the effect of an incident on business processes. We will evaluate the impact based on several criteria:
- The number of affected users.
- The potential financial losses.
- The number of affected services.
- Breaches of regulations or laws.
- The reputation of the company.
- Other reasons.

## Urgency
Urgency is the time it takes to an incident to have a significant impact on business.

## Priorities
Priority will be based on the impact and urgency of the issue and will be used to identify the required timeframe for remediation actions to take place. The assignement of a priority code will determine how the incident will be taken care of our support staff.

P1 | Critical | Interruption making a critical functionality inaccessible or a complete network interruption causing a severe impact on services availability. There is no possible alternative. | 4 hours
