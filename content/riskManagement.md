## What is Risk
Risk is the combination of the Likelihood of a problem occurring and the Impact of the problem if it were to occur, a problem is anything that may seriously threaten the short or long term success of a software project, product, or business.

## How we manage risks?
We use the following major activities:

1. Identification: We List the direct and indirect risks.
2. Analysis: We see what risks to prioritize.
3. Mitigation: We define strategies to avoid/transfer, minimize/control, or accept/defer the risk.
4. Monitoring: We update the Jira and triggering contingencies as things change.

## Requirements Analysis
When gathering our requirements for our project, we analysed and organised each requirement into Jira and in the backlog. Risk factors that we considered at this time were:

1. Each requirement must have an identifiable tracebility source.
2. Some requirements had be verifiable through testing eg log in.
3. All requirement must be defined as valid through a review of pull requests on github.
4. Requirement were sorted and are consistent through sprints on jira.
5. Our Documentation is done right to stop any inconsistency with requirements. We seperated documentation for risk, requirements etc.

## Types of risks we looked out for

1. Estimation and scheduling
The unique nature of this projects creates problems for our team in estimating what needed to be done. 

We used Jira to help us with estimating times for certain jobs. We constantly monitored our project so that you apply lessons learnt in the future.

2. Sudden growth in requirements
As a project progressed, issues were not identified earlier. 

We solved this by asking the PO questions, which left us with no last-minute hurdle to meeting our deadline.

3. Employee turnover
Every project has a number of developers working on it. When a developers leaves, he or she may take critical information with him/her. This can delay, and sometimes derail an entire project. Ensure you have resources where team members can collaborate and share knowledge.

 We had prepared for this during our project but thankfully this did not happen.

4. Breakdown of specification
During the initial phases of integration and coding, requirements might conflict. Moreover, developers may find that even the specification is unclear or incomplete. 

Everytime we cam across this, we asked the PO for clarifactaion.

5. Productivity issues
On projects involving long timelines, developers tend to take things easy to begin with. As a result, sometimes, they lose significant time to complete the project. Set a realistic schedule, and stick to it.

This did happen with us, for example paddys weekend. That week a few of us took things easy, but after, we got back on track.

6. Gold plating
Developers sometimes like to show off their skills by adding unnecessary features. For instance, a developer might add Flash to a basic login module to make it look ‘stylish’. Again, this is a waste of programming hours.

This did not Happen in our team. We had a strict time limit and we had no real time for extra features as we had too many sories and epics to fullfill on jira.

7. Procedural risks
Day-to-day operational activities might hamper due to improper process implementation, conflicting priorities, or a lack of clarity in responsibilities.

The only thing that really hampered us was trying to get everyone together as everyone had jobs, kids and all of us lived all over Ireland and France. We did conquer this by having set times on Monday Thursday and after Fridays class.

9. Unavoidable risks
These include changes in government policy, the obsolescence of software or other risks that cannot be controlled or estimated. As the field of software development becomes more and more complex, the risks associated with it have intensified. It is vital that development firms focus on strategic planning to mitigate such risks.

We came across a few of these and overcame them. Example:

We tried Installing Artifactory but there was errors with Tomcat. So we used Docker with Artifactory.
