## What is Risk
Risk is the combination of the Likelihood of a problem occurring and the Impact of the problem if it were to occur, a problem is anything that may seriously threaten the short or long term success of a software project, product, or business.

## How we manage risks?
We use the following major activities:

1. Identification: We List the direct and indirect risks.
2. Analysis: We see what risks to prioritize.
3. Mitigation: We define strategies to avoid/transfer, minimize/control, or accept/defer the risk.
4. Monitoring: We update the Jira and triggering contingencies as things change.

## Requirements Analysis
When gathering our requirements for our project, we analysed and organised each requirement into Jira and in the backlog. Risk factors that we considered at this time were:

1. Each requirement must have an identifiable tracebility source.
2. Some requirements had be verifiable through testing eg log in.
3. All requirement must be defined as valid through a review of pull requests on github.
4. Requirement were sorted and are consistent through sprints on jira.
5. Our Documentation is done right to stop any inconsistency with requirements. We seperated documentation for risk, requirements etc.
